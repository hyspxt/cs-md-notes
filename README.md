## **hys' notes**

yo fellow reader, hope ur doing good <3
here u will find my notes regarding my MSc degree in CS at Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna ([UniBo](https://www.unibo.it/it)).  Many courses are in fact optional, for so this work comprehends only the courses I've chosen and taken. Still, few of them are mandatory.

### **about the notes**

I'm taking these notes with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). If you prefer a FOSS alternative I suggest you [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). I tried it some time ago and it's rocks! Unluckily, for my purposes I still find Obsidian a bit more complete and tunable.
