## **hys' notes**

yo fellow reader, hope ur doing good <3

here u will find my notes regarding my MSc degree in CS at Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna ([UniBo](https://www.unibo.it/it)).  Many courses are in fact optional, for so this work comprehends only the courses I've chosen and taken. Still, few of them are mandatory.

### **about the notes**

I'm taking these notes with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). If you prefer a FOSS alternative I suggest you [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). I tried it some time ago and it's rocks! Unluckily, for my purposes I still find Obsidian a bit more complete and tunable :( . 
But never say never!

Here you will find an good amount of memes based on this formula:

tiredness + difficoult argument = + memes

Hope you won't get distracted, my only intention is to ease your reading ðŸ«¢! Additionally, notes will be taken in both italian and english, with no particular reason behind, if not the courses topics themselves.

Last thing, [here](https://github.com/hyspxt/cs-md-notes) you can find the repository for offline reading. Alternatively, I hosted my [notes here](https://hyspxt.github.io/md-notes/) with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). If you're reading this, you've probably you already know that, blep.
