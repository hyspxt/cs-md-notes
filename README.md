## **hys' notes**

yo fellow reader, hope ur doing good <3

here u will find my notes regarding my MSc degree in CS at Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna ([UniBo](https://www.unibo.it/it)).  Many courses are in fact optional, for so this work comprehends only the courses I've chosen and taken. Still, few of them are mandatory.

### **about the notes**

I'm taking these notes with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). If you prefer a FOSS alternative I suggest you [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). I tried it some time ago and it's rocks! Unluckily, for my purposes I still find Obsidian a bit more complete and tunable :( . But never say never!

Here you will find an ungodly amount of meme based on this formula:
$$
\text{tiredness + difficoult argument = + memes}
$$
Hope you won't get distracted, my only intention is to ease your reading ðŸ«¢! Additionally, notes will be taken in both italian and english, with no particular reason behind, if not the courses topics themselves.

Last thing, here you can find the repository for offline reading. Alternatively, I hosted my notes here. If you're reading this, you've probably you already know that, blep.

### **others**

As said, these are MSc notes. If you're interested in my Bachelor notes, look up in my notion here!
