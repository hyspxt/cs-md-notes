> 	 - you can develop a project approved by the teacher, write a report about it (at least 10 pages) and discuss it at the oral exam with some other very general questions on other course topics. A list of project proposals can be found [here](http://corpora.ficlit.unibo.it/NLP/index.php?slab=projects). Students are allowed to suggest other project topics to the teacher;
> 	 - a classical oral colloquium consisting of at least three questions (either general or very specific) on the course contents.

> [!NOTE] Course content
>  - fundamentals about NLP, probabilistic models (n-grams), deep learning models and LLMs, evaluation techniques of models and corpora handling
>  - computational phonetics and speech processing, tokenisation and sentence splitting, computational morphology, computational syntax, computational semantics
>  - downstream tasks: document classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, semantic textual similarity and prompting pre-trained LLMs. Extra: network embedding, ASR with LLM, generative models and topic modeling.
