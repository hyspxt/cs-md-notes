# Using XML/SQL

As we saw, XML is used primarily for **data exchange** between applications and **representation of semi-structured data**. But, as today, the majority of data is locally stored in relational form. Then, we need a 'bridge': <b style="color:red">SQL/XML</b>, a SQL extension.
Fundamentally, we can:
- **Extract XML** from one or more relational tables (SQL->XML).
- **Store XML** in one or more relational tables (XML->SQL).
The first option is simpler, as XML can represent both structured and semi-structured data, but it isn't as simple as that for the second.

## SQL->XML alternatives

This is a simple process, but we can accomplish it in two more ways.
### Through mapping

|id|name|surname|salary|
|---|---|---|---|
|01|Bob|Ross|2000|
|02|Jane|Doe|3000|

> The mapping works as follow:
