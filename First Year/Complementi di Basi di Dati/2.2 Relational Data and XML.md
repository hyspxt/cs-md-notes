# Using XML/SQL

As we saw, XML is used primarily for **data exchange** between applications and **representation of semi-structured data**. But, as today, the majority of data is locally stored in relational form. Then, we need a 'bridge': <b style="color:red">SQL/XML</b>, a SQL extension.
Fundamentally, we can:
- **Extract XML** from one or more relational tables (SQL->XML).
- **Store XML** in one or more relational tables (XML->SQL).
The first option is simpler, as XML can represent both structured and semi-structured data, but it isn't as simple as that for the second.

## SQL->XML alternatives

This is a simple process, but we can accomplish it in two more ways.
### Through mapping

> [!INFO] Mapping - SQL->XML
> We start from a relational table: `Employees`.
> 
> |id|name|surname|salary|
|---|---|---|---|
|01|Bob|Ross|2000|
|02|Jane|Doe|3000|
> 
>The mapping works as follow:
>- Table's name becomes the name of the XML Document.
> - Each row wil be included in a *\<row>* element and each column value becomes the element content.
> - Null values are represented with the attribute `xsi:nil="true"`.

> Moreover, we can extract specific data using [[2.3 XQuery|XQuery]]:
