# Using XML/SQL

As we saw, XML is used primarily for **data exchange** between applications and **representation of semi-structured data**. But, as today, the majority of data is locally stored in relational form. Then, we need a 'bridge': <b style="color:red">SQL/XML</b>, a SQL extension.
Fundamentally, we can:
- **Extract XML** from one or more relational tables.
- **Store XML** in one or more relational tables.
The first option is simpler, as XML can represent both structured and semi-structured data, but it isn't as simple as that for the second.
