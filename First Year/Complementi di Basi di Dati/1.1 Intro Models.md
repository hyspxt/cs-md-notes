# Introduction


Generally speaking, we know how to work with **structured and relational data** and [its management systems](https://www.notion.so/hyspxt/Basi-di-Dati-9-CFU-3ab24755a0a34f2eafb102b2c03d67cf) (SQL, ER diagrams, etc). However, today we produce massive amounts of <b style="color: red;">non-relational and semi-structured data</b>, which properties substantially differs from the structured counterpart. Here, we will study methods to handle it.

> *Structured* (with a [[+definitions#^def-schema|schema]]!):

>|  id   |   name  | surname |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   01  |  Bob    | Ross |
|   02  |  Jane    | Doe |
> *Unstructured* -> images, video, documents, chats...

Unstructured data require specific processing (e.g., analysis algorithms). In particular, **Information Retrieval** is how we call the study of schema-less data. Classical DBMS struggle to handle unstructured data, but
