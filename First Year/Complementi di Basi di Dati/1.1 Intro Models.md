# Introduction


Generally speaking, we know how to work with **structured and relational data** and [its management systems](https://www.notion.so/hyspxt/Basi-di-Dati-9-CFU-3ab24755a0a34f2eafb102b2c03d67cf) (SQL, ER diagrams, etc). However, today we produce massive amounts of <b style="color: red;">non-relational data</b>, which properties substantially differs from the structured counterpart. Here, we will study methods to handle it.
