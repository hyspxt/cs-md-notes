## XML

The main **format** for semi-structured data representation is <b style="color:red">XML</b>, a standard which permit us to work both on data and schema in a human-understandable way. XML can handle structured data too, with a "relational system -> XML" conversion.

> [!EXAMPLE] Example of a relational model for XML data
> ```XML
> <doc>
> 	<project> <ref> Frank </ref> </project>
> 	<project>
> 		<ref> George </ref>
> 		 <project> <ref> George </ref> </project>
> 		 <project> <ref> Jon </ref> 
> 			 <project> <ref> Bob </ref> </project>
> 			 <project> <ref> Frank </ref> </project>
> 		</project>
> 	</project>
> </doc>
> ```
> This XML data produces the following tree:
> ![[xml_tree_ex.png|<u>On the left</u>: relational model with two tables. <u>On the right</u>: a gerarchic tree. In the latter case, the model is **irregular** as each nodes hasn't the same number of child nodes.]]
> 


An XML document is made of three parts, in order:
- **Prolog** -> contains information for interpreting the document.
- **Document Type Definition** (DTD) -> <u>NOT mandatory</u>. Defines through markup declarations costraints for the document, like which elements can be included and default values for attributes
