## XML

The main **format** for semi-structured data representation is <b style="color:red">XML</b>, a standard which permit us to work both on data and schema in a human-understandable way. XML can handle structured data too, with a "relational system -> XML" conversion.

> [!EXAMPLE] Example of a relational model for XML data
> ```XML
> <doc>
> 	<project> <ref> Frank </ref> </project>
> 	<project>
> 		<ref> George </ref>
> 		 <project> <ref> George </ref> </project>
> 		 <project> <ref> Jon </ref> 
> 			 <project> <ref> Bob </ref> </project>
> 			 <project> <ref> Frank </ref> </project>
> 		</project>
> 	</project>
> </doc>
> ```
> This XML data produces the following tree:
> ![[xml_tree_ex.png|<u>On the left</u>: relational model with two tables. <u>On the right</u>: a gerarchic tree. In the latter case, the model is **irregular** as each nodes hasn't the same number of child nodes.]]

An XML document is made of three sections, in order:
- **Prolog** -> contains information for interpreting the document in form of declarations, grammar rules and processing instructions.
- **Document Type Definition** (DTD) -> <u>NOT mandatory</u>. Defines through markup declarations costraints for the document, like which <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">elements</mark> can be included and default values for attributes.
- **Document Body** -> made of one element, eventually with others nested.
More complex constraints (keys, etc..) can be expressed (*in XML!*) through an **XML Schema**, which is an alternative to DTD.

> [!EXAMPLE] Example of an XML Document
> ![[xml_doc.png]]
> A <u>well-formed XML</u> document comprehends<u></u>:
> - An element must be between the opening and the closing tag.
> - Attribute values must be between "" or ''.
> - Data **must** be stored as element content and not in attributes value.
> 
>  Mind that an XML document is <u>valid</u> if it contains and respect a DTD. Then, a document can be well-formed, but non-valid!
